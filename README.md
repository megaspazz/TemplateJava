# TemplateJava
Java Template for Competitive Programming

## Setup

1.  Install the JDK for your target Java version.  You can [download it here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2.  Optionally, install a text editor.  I like using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## How to Use

1.  Put your files in the `src/` folder.  I prefer to put them in subfolders, like `src/codeforces` or `src/topcoder`.
2.  If your program reads from `stdin`, then you can use the templates in `src/#templates/`, which have wrappers for reading `stdin` and printing to `stdout`.
3.  Put your input in `io/in.txt`.
4.  To run the most recently modified file, run the command `.\run_latest.bat`.
5.  The program output and build errors will be printed in the console, but you can also look at `io/out.txt` and `io/err.txt`.
